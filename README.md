# cookieclicker-bot
Approaching Cookie Clicker as a microeconomic optimization problem, this bot continuously generates resources, evaluates marginal costs, and allocates cookies toward upgrades with the highest return on investment. It acts like an automated agent that maximizes long-run cookie output under dynamic cost constraints.
