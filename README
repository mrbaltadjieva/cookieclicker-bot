# 🍪 EXTREME COOKIE CLICKER BOT (EDGE EDITION)

A Python automation script using **Selenium** and **Microsoft Edge** to play Cookie Clicker with a focus on **economic optimization**.

This project pairs the practical automation script (`cookie_bot.py`) with a detailed microeconomic analysis (`ECONOMICS_OF_COOKIE_CLICKER.md`) to show how automation can achieve the theoretical optimum in resource allocation.

## 🚀 Script Overview

The bot executes five key actions, all directly related to maximizing the **Marginal Return Per Cost (MRPC)** of investment:

| Bot Function (Code) | Economic Principle (Article) | Optimization Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`cookie.click()`** | Maximize Short-Run Production | Generate working capital stock. |
| **`buy_best_building()`** | **Capital Deepening & MRPC** | Continuously reinvest in the highest-yield, most efficient assets (buildings). |
| **`buy_upgrades()`** | **Endogenous Growth Theory** | Immediately adopt technology to permanently raise the production frontier (productivity). |
| **`click_golden_cookies()`** | **Stochastic Productivity Shocks** | Capture random market windfalls instantly to maximize the multiplicative effect. |
| **`pop_wrinklers()`** | **Leveraging Compounding Capital** | Harvest high-interest savings to fund the next round of large-scale asset purchases. |

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x**
2.  **Microsoft Edge** browser installed.
3.  The **Microsoft Edge WebDriver** (often installed automatically with the latest Edge, but may need manual download if not found by Selenium).

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd extreme-cookie-bot
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    You only need `selenium`.
    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```
3.  **Run the Bot:**
    ```bash
    python cookie_bot.py
    ```
    The script will open a new Edge window, navigate to Cookie Clicker, and begin the automation loop.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can easily adjust the bot's behavior by modifying the constants at the top of `cookie_bot.py`:

```python
# ============================================================
# CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================

CLICK_INTERVAL = 0.0001      # How fast the cookie is clicked (affects lag!)
UPGRADE_INTERVAL = 0.5       # How often to check/buy upgrades
BUILD_INTERVAL = 1.5         # How often to check/buy the best building
RUN_MINUTES = 5              # Total run time
# ... and so on
