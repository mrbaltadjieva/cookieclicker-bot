# 🍪 EXTREME COOKIE CLICKER BOT (EDGE EDITION)

A Python automation script using **Selenium** and **Microsoft Edge** to play Cookie Clicker with a focus on **economic optimization**.

This project pairs the practical automation script (`cookie_bot.py`) with a detailed microeconomic analysis (`ECONOMICS_OF_COOKIE_CLICKER.md`) to show how automation can achieve the theoretical optimum in resource allocation.

---

## 🚀 1. The Automation Script (`cookie_bot.py`)

The bot executes five key actions, all directly related to maximizing the **Marginal Return Per Cost (MRPC)** of investment:

| Bot Function (Code) | Economic Principle (Article) | Optimization Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`cookie.click()`** | Maximize Short-Run Production | Generate working capital stock. |
| **`buy_highest_mrpc_building()`** | **Capital Deepening & MRPC** | Continuously reinvest in the highest-yield, most efficient assets. |
| **`buy_upgrades()`** | **Endogenous Growth Theory** | Immediately adopt technology to permanently raise the production frontier (productivity). |
| **`click_golden_cookies()`** | **Stochastic Productivity Shocks** | Capture random market windfalls instantly to maximize the multiplicative effect. |
| **`pop_wrinklers()`** | **Leveraging Compounding Capital** | Harvest high-interest savings to fund the next round of large-scale asset purchases. |

### 🛠️ Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.x and Microsoft Edge browser.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** `pip install selenium`
3.  **Run the Bot:**
    ```bash
    python cookie_bot.py
    ```
    *(The bot is configured to automatically load game data using JavaScript injection, or you can paste a save string into the script.)*

## 📈 2. The Economic Advisor (`economic_advisor.py`)

This standalone tool allows the user to manually apply the bot's core economic logic to any assets in the game, turning the theory into a practical, menu-driven calculator.

### Analysis Modes:

The script offers three critical decision-making modes, driven by inputting your current Cookies Per Second (CPS) and asset costs/gains:

| Mode | Economic Goal | What it Answers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. MRPC Comparison** (Choice 1) | **Marginal Analysis** | Which of the currently *available* assets (buildings or upgrades) gives the **highest CPS gain per cookie spent**? |
| **2. Intertemporal Analysis** (Choice 2) | **Opportunity Cost** | Should I *buy a cheap asset now* to boost CPS, or *save all my money* to reach the next huge expensive asset faster? |
| **3. Threshold Analysis** (Choice 3) | **Efficiency Threshold** | **What is the minimum CPS gain** the next expensive, unknown asset *must provide* to be a more efficient investment than your current best option? |

### How to Use the Advisor:

1.  **Save** the companion script as `economic_advisor.py`.
2.  **Run** the advisor from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python economic_advisor.py
    ```
3.  Follow the prompts to enter your current CPS and select the analysis mode you wish to run.
